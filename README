I just spent almost 2 hrs on this, I have avoided most of the error handling, I have tested it on windows xp sp2 and linux '2.6.38-8-generic' with python 2.7 

BMP-stegano (steganography using BMP file)

	This program is just a demonstration of steganography
	The purpose of this program is pure academic demostration of steganography
	Use of this program/such programs may be illegal in your country

Program usage:

	bmp-stegano <bmp-file> <any-file> [-e]
	bmp-file: bmp file you from which you either want to extract or embed data
	any-file: file which you either want to extract data to or embed into BMP
	-e: specifying -e option will extract data from bmp-file to any-file otherwise
	    embed data from any-file to bmp-file 

Current program is designed to work with only those BMP-images that don't have RGBQUAD or color table embeded in them like 24-bit DIB. The program will not try to VALIDATE the image before embeding.There is also limit of embeding file of MAX size of 2^32 bytes (4096MB) no matter what CPU (64or32bit) host system supports, this is a direct consequence of BMP file design.

Standalone and installer binaries are available for windows and for all other system, python script is available.

Builiding windows installer will also require NSIS script compiler.
